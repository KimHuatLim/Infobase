# Infobase
Just for sharing, it's a simple web app for myself to understand more about the data and API around it.

Name       :
[Infobase](https://wingsmaker.github.io/Infobase/Infobase.html)

Purpose   :
Prototype for capturing the requirements and understanding the data services using API. ( Wireframe concept )
Not a real app for the “to-be” ACO-ICO project.


Platform  : 
Windows, Mac,  Android, IOS over public internet as well as HVPN 

App Type : 
Web App ( Serverless via GITHUB ), support desktop mode as well as mobile device mode.

API Info   :
http://hapi.fhir.org/home 
https://fhir.epic.com/Specifications
These were open source api, not necessary mean for our project, just for new comer like me to understand the FHIR.
